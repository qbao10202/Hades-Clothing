# Product Availability and Cart Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Product Stock Display Issue
**Problem**: Products were showing as "Out of Stock" even when they had stock
**Root Cause**: The ProductService was using `getIsActive()` method instead of `isActive()` method for filtering
**Solution**: Updated ProductService to use `p.isActive()` instead of `Boolean.TRUE.equals(p.getIsActive())`

### 2. Cart API 400 Bad Request Error
**Problem**: Cart API was returning 400 Bad Request errors
**Root Cause**: Cart endpoints were not properly configured in Spring Security
**Solution**: Added `/api/cart/**` to security configuration with proper role-based access

### 3. Database Schema Cleanup
**Problem**: Unused columns in products table were causing confusion and overhead
**Solution**: Removed the following columns from Product entity and database:
- weight
- dimensions  
- sku
- barcode
- model
- is_featured
- is_virtual
- requires_shipping
- tax_rate

### 4. Product Creation Default Values
**Problem**: New products might not have proper default values
**Solution**: Updated ProductService to always set `isActive = true` when creating new products

## Files Modified:

### Backend Changes:
1. **Product.java** - Removed unused fields and their getters/setters
2. **ProductService.java** - Fixed isActive() method usage and removed getFeaturedProducts()
3. **ProductRepository.java** - Removed queries for deleted fields
4. **ProductController.java** - Removed featured products endpoint and updated create method
5. **ProductDTO.java** - Removed unused fields and their getters/setters
6. **SecurityConfig.java** - Added cart endpoint configuration

### Database Migration:
1. **cleanup-migration.sql** - Script to remove unused columns from products table

## Key Changes Summary:

1. **Fixed Product Availability Logic**: Changed from `getIsActive()` to `isActive()` in ProductService filtering
2. **Enhanced Cart Security**: Added proper role-based access control for cart endpoints
3. **Cleaned Database Schema**: Removed 9 unused columns from products table
4. **Streamlined APIs**: Removed featured products endpoint since is_featured field was removed
5. **Improved Defaults**: New products always created with isActive = true

## Next Steps:

1. Run the database migration script to remove unused columns
2. Start the backend application
3. Test product availability display on frontend
4. Test cart functionality (add/remove items)
5. Verify that products with stock show as available
6. Test that customers can add available products to cart

## Expected Results:

- Products with stock > 0 should show as available
- "Add to Cart" button should be enabled for available products
- Cart API should work without 400 errors
- Database should be cleaner with only necessary columns
- New products should always be active by default
