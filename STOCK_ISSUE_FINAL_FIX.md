# Product "Out of Stock" Issue - Final Fix Summary

## Root Cause Analysis:
The products were showing as "Out of Stock" despite having stock_quantity > 0 in the database due to **frontend-backend model mismatch**.

## Issues Found & Fixed:

### 1. Frontend Model Mismatch
**Problem**: Frontend `Product` and `ProductDTO` interfaces still contained removed fields:
- `isFeatured`, `isVirtual`, `requiresShipping`, `taxRate`
- `weight`, `dimensions`, `sku`, `barcode`, `model`

**Solution**: Updated frontend models to match backend structure.

### 2. Removed Backend API Endpoint References
**Problem**: Frontend was trying to call `/api/products/featured` which was removed.
**Solution**: Removed `getFeaturedProducts()` calls from frontend service.

### 3. Demo Data Inconsistency
**Problem**: Frontend service had demo products with old field structure.
**Solution**: Updated demo data to match new model structure.

## Files Modified:

### Frontend:
1. **models/index.ts** - Updated Product and ProductDTO interfaces
2. **services/product.service.ts** - Removed featured products calls and updated demo data

### Backend (Previously Fixed):
1. **Product.java** - Added missing ProductImage import
2. **ProductService.java** - Fixed isActive() method calls
3. **SecurityConfig.java** - Added cart endpoint security
4. **Removed unused fields** from Product entity and DTO

## Testing Steps:

1. **Start Backend**:
```bash
cd backend
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

2. **Test API Endpoints**:
```bash
# Test products endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/api/products

# Test categories endpoint  
curl http://localhost:8080/api/categories

# Test products by category
curl http://localhost:8080/api/products/category/1
```

3. **Start Frontend**:
```bash
cd frontend
ng serve
```

4. **Verify Results**:
- Products with stock > 0 should show "Add to Cart" button
- Products should not show "Out of Stock" when they have stock
- Cart functionality should work without 400 errors

## Expected API Response Format:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "productCode": "HADES001",
  "name": "HADES SPLICE POLO - BROWN",
  "stockQuantity": 50,
  "isActive": true,
  "price": 520000,
  "images": [...],
  ...
}
```

## Database Commands to Execute:

```sql
-- Ensure all products are active
UPDATE products SET is_active = TRUE WHERE is_active IS NULL OR is_active = FALSE;

-- Verify stock quantities
SELECT id, product_code, name, stock_quantity, is_active 
FROM products 
WHERE stock_quantity > 0 
ORDER BY id;
```

## Key Points:
- Backend now correctly filters products by `isActive()` method
- Frontend models match backend structure exactly
- Removed fields are no longer referenced anywhere
- All products with stock > 0 and isActive = true should be available
